# Mikanda
A repository for deep learning models in ecological applications (in progress)

# Etymology of name
Mikanda is a swahili word that means "strands" and since there is no swahili word for neural networks, i looked for the nearest word that resembles a network to name my new repoitory for deep learning ecological applications.
