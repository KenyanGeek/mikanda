# Mikanda
A repository for deep learning models in ecological applications (in progress)

# Etymology 
Mikanda is a swahili word that means "strands" and since there is no swahili word for neural networks, i searched for the nearest word that might represent a network and named this new repository for deep learning ecological applications.
